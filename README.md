## Hi there 👋
Hi, I’m Divakar.

I build software that is thoughtful, practical, and grounded in real use —
from full-stack web systems to applied AI and machine-learning driven tools.

My interests sit at the intersection of engineering and intelligence,
where clean architecture, clarity, and purpose matter more than noise. 🤍


About
I enjoy working across the stack — designing APIs, building user-facing interfaces,
and experimenting with AI systems that solve real problems rather than just showcasing models.

I’ve worked in production environments as a MERN stack developer,
contributing to scalable features such as authentication, role-based access,
and real-time interactions.


Selected Work

Neuro-RAG  
Behavioural competency evaluation system using LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation,
focused on adaptive and explainable skill assessment.

SoulShine  
AI-powered mental health monitoring system leveraging neural networks
to analyze emotional patterns and provide personalized insights.

Agromart  
Deep-learning based crop disease detection platform using ResNet50,
designed to support early diagnosis and farmer decision-making.

FlyHigh  
Online flight ticket booking system built with React and Spring Boot,
with secure transaction handling and backend service integration.

EduGo  
Personalized learning discovery platform focused on connecting students
with the right instructors through intelligent recommendations.

Experience

MERN Stack Developer Intern — Yale Infotech  
Worked on a production-grade HR management system,
implementing authentication flows, role-based access control,
and real-time features while improving overall system usability.


Currently

Exploring applied AI systems, scalable backend design,
and building projects that balance engineering depth with real-world impact.
