Divakar here! 👋

My interests span full-stack development and applied AI,
with a focus on structure, clarity, and real-world usefulness.

I enjoy building things from the ground up 
thinking through the problem, shaping the architecture,  
and refining the implementation until it makes sense.  
Most of my projects are learning-driven,  
designed to explore how modern software and intelligent systems behave in practice.
I'm intereseted in learning about AI,it's architecture and much more.
