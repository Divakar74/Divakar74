Learning Software Engineering · Exploring AI & Systems  

I’m a learner building software to understand how things work —  
from full-stack web applications to applied AI systems.

Most of my projects are built end-to-end: starting with the problem,
thinking through the structure, writing the code, and refining it
until it feels clear and usable. I enjoy learning by building,
and improving through iteration rather than shortcuts.

This GitHub is a record of that process — curiosity turned into code,
systems in progress, and ideas slowly taking shape.
